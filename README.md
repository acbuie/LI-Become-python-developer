# LI-Become-python-developer
Repository for all the exercises associated with the 'Become a Python Developer' learning path on LinkedIn Learning. 

Code under `# TODO ` comments is code not provided by the course, and completed by me. 

## Folder Structure
As there are a variety of LinkedIn Learning courses in this learning path, each one will have it's own folder and developement environment. 

## Notes
Course 2, 'Programming Foundations: Object-Oriented Design' has no programming associated with it. I have included a folded for this course for completeness, but it is empty.
